Marriage in Cyprus

## Before you start

Contact the local authorities in Cyprus to find out about local
marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married

The UK doesn’t issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for marriages
in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked
to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to
marry.

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Cyprus it
- would be allowed under UK law

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British
citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen)
once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
